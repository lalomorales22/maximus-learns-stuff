# **App Name**: Maximus Learns

## Core Features:

- Interactive Learning Modules: Implement an engaging UI with separate sections for math, reading and typing, each designed with bright colors and interactive elements appropriate for children.
- Adaptive Difficulty Adjustment: Use an AI tool to dynamically adjust the difficulty of the exercises based on Maximus's performance, ensuring he's always challenged but not overwhelmed. This applies to all learning modules.
- Progress Tracking and Rewards: Create a simple scoring system to reward progress and encourage continued engagement in each of the Math, Reading, and Typing Modules.
- Module Navigation: Ensure easy navigation between modules (math, reading, typing) to promote a seamless and versatile learning experience.

## Style Guidelines:

- Use a palette of bright, primary colors (red, blue, yellow) to capture and maintain a child's attention.
- Accent: Green (#32CD32) to indicate correct answers and positive feedback.
- Employ large, clear, and age-appropriate fonts like Comic Sans MS (though alternatives can be explored for better readability while retaining a friendly feel).
- Utilize easily recognizable and relatable icons for each section and game element to aid in navigation and comprehension.
- Design a clean, uncluttered layout with plenty of spacing and clearly defined sections to reduce cognitive overload.
- Incorporate subtle and cheerful animations for transitions, feedback, and rewards to enhance engagement without being distracting.
